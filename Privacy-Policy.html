    <h1>Notify - Privacy Policy</h1>


    <!-- <h2>Privacy Policy</h2> -->
    <p>
        Aditya Khot built the Notify app as a Free app.
        This Service is provided by Aditya Khot at no cost and is intended for use as is.

        This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure
        of Personal Information if anyone decided to use Notify app.

    <p>
        If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in
        relation to this policy. The Information that I collect is used for improving the user experience. 
        I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described
        in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    
    <p>
        For a better user experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain
        personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not
        collected by me in any way.
    </p>


    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>
        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
        These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
        memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Service does not use “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and
        libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
        either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose
        to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
    </p>


    <h2>Service Providers</h2>

    <p> 
        I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
        <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
        <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> 
        I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to
        your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However,
        they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
    </p>


    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p> 
        I value your trust in providing us your Information, thus we are striving
        to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
        the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee
        it's absolute security.
    </p>


    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>
        This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
        to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
        advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over
        and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites
        or services.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect
        personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child
        under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete this from
        our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal
        information, please contact me to take necessary actions.
    </p>
